Description: # fesh2
        Geodetic VLBI schedule management and processing
        
        Fesh2 provides automated schedule file preparation for the current, next or specified
        session. It requires an installation of the [NASA Field System](https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs).
        When run, a check for the latest version of the Master File(s) is done first,
        but skipped if the time since the last check is less than a specified amount
        (configureable on the command line or in the config file). Similarly, checks
        on schedule files are only done if the time since the last check exceeds a
        specified time. Checks can be forced on the command line.
        
        ## Installation
        ```pip install fesh2```
        
        ## Configuration
        Fesh2 looks for a configuration file in `/usr2/control` called `fesh2.config`. This will need to be set up for your station before running it.
        
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        usage: fesh2 [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-g GET] [-t TMASTER] [-s TSCHED] [-m] [-u] [-d]
                     [-n] [-a] [-o] [-l LOOKAHEAD] [-y YEAR]
                     [stns [stns ...]]
        
        positional arguments:
          stns                  Stations to consider (default "hb ke yg ho")
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                                The configuration file to use. (default is
                                /usr2/control/fesh2.config)
          -g GET, --get GET     Just get a schedule for this specified session. Give
                                the name of the session (e.g. r4951).
          -t TMASTER, --tmaster TMASTER
                                Only check for a new master file if the last check was
                                more than this number of hours ago. The default is set
                                in the configuration file.
          -s TSCHED, --tsched TSCHED
                                Only check for a new schedule file (SKD or VEX) if the
                                last check was more than this number of hours ago. The
                                default is set in the configuration file.
          -m, --master-update   Force a download of the Master Schedule (default =
                                False).
          -u, --sched-update    Force a download of the Schedules (default = False).
          -d, --no-drudg        Force NOT to run Drudg on the downloaded/updated
                                schedules (default = False)
          -n, --current, --now  Only process the current or next experiment
          -a, --all             find the experiments with all "stns" in it
          -o, --once            Just run once then exit, don't go into a wait loop
                                (default = False)
          -l LOOKAHEAD, --lookahead LOOKAHEAD
                                only look for schedules less than this number of days
                                away (default is 7)
          -y YEAR, --year YEAR  The year of the Master Schedule (default is 2020)
        ```
